# Moi3dScripts
Moi 3D Scripts collected from the Web

I wish to thank Max for his tremendous contributions to Moi3d. His website has gone dark. It was rumored due to the war in Ukraine. I hope all is well. http://moi.maxsm.net

Commands folder has edited scripts. The only one right now is for cycles to work with the Cycles 3.3 build.

Thank to the blender Devs for correcting the build errors. August 2022.

Cycles 3.3 extended is built with optix and sm_35 and up.
